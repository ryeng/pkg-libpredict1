libpredict
==========

A satellite orbit prediction library.


Building
--------

We recommend using out-of-source builds.

```
cd $SOURCEDIR
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```


Installation
------------

```
make install
```

The install location is defined by `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, which
defaults to `/usr/local`. To relocate the whole installation (to make
usr/local etc. inside another directory, e.g., if you want to make a
tarball or package it afterwards), use `make DESTDIR=/foo/bar install`.


Linking
-------

The library comes with pkg-config information, so the include and
library paths and flags can be found using the `pkg-config` command or
by using the `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` autotools macro or CMake command.
